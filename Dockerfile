# AI-Native ERP — Frontend (Next.js 14) production image
#
# Not verified with a live `docker build` — no Docker daemon available in
# the sandbox this was written in (see docs/production-hardening.md). The
# `npm run build` this depends on (with next.config.js's `output: "standalone"`,
# added alongside this Dockerfile) was verified locally and does produce the
# .next/standalone/server.js this image runs.
